# Literature for back-end developer

> You are reading this [...] for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a better programmer. Good. We need better programmers.
> 
> -Robert C. Martin (from Clean Code)

We have, again and again, experienced that it's not enough to be a good developer — let alone be a developer. We also have
experienced in our team that once a developer has studied the correct content, the code quality and the collective peace of mind
have multiplied. That's why we have curated a great deal of material for ourselves to become better.

In IDF, it is essential for developers to study the content in our library. This list is not here for a developer to ignore.
An IDF developer should have read the whole library — **at the least**.

> The frenetic rate of change in our industry means that software developers must continue to learn copious quantities just to keep up.
Woe to the architects who stop coding—they will rapidly find themselves irrelevant. Woe to the programmers who stop learning new
languages—they will watch as the industry passes them by. Woe to the developers who fail to learn new disciplines and techniques—their
peers will excel as they decline.

> -Robert C. Martin (from Clean *Coder*)

## Index

You can find all books and videos on the shared folder `IDF - Shared Reading - Library of Development literature and videos`.
_Warning for devs having small SSDs:_ The videos may take up more than 10gb on your disk. That's why
you may want to selectively sync those you want to study into your computer when you want to study them.
