# IxDF's Literature for back-end developers

> You are reading this [...] for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a better programmer. Good. We need better programmers.
>
> -Robert C. Martin (from Clean Code)

We have, again and again, experienced that itâ€™s not enough to be a good developer â€” let alone be a developer. We also have
experienced in our team that once a developer has studied the correct content, the code quality and the collective peace of mind
have multiplied. Thatâ€™s why we have curated a great deal of material for ourselves to become better.

> The frenetic rate of change in our industry means that software developers must continue to learn copious quantities just to keep up.
> Woe to the architects who stop codingâ€”they will rapidly find themselves irrelevant. Woe to the programmers who stop learning new
> languagesâ€”they will watch as the industry passes them by. Woe to the developers who fail to learn new disciplines and techniquesâ€”their
> peers will excel as they decline.

> -Robert C. Martin (from Clean _Coder_)
