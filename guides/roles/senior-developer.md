# Expectations from Developers

We are a small team of senior developers, and the IxDF does not employ junior or medium level developers.
Thatâ€™s why this list only includes our expectations for senior developers.

## Senior developer

1.  A senior developer understands and is aligned with the IxDF Company Culture which is **very** thoroughly explained in our "IxDF Company Culture Course" (taken during your onboarding phase).
1.  **Seriousness firstly means "responsibility"**. Responsibility for your decisions, solutions, code, and communication with the team.
1.  A senior developer is [able to carry a message to Garcia](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/hubbard1899.pdf):
    They **can take the initiative** when carrying out a challenging assignment.
1.  A senior developer **has experience**; because they are able to learn from their mistakes.
1.  A senior developer **helps their team get better every day**. E.g. by energizing his/her colleagues on group calls, setting an example of awesome code that awes the rest of the team, inspiring colleagues with his/her results/help, etc. etc.
1.  A senior developer **finds and fixes the root causes of the problem** and not just the symptoms.
1.  A senior developer can **self-reliantly deliver working software**.
1.  A senior developer understands that their job is to **provide solutions to problems**, not to write code.
1.  A senior developer [**knows their tools**](https://stitcher.io/blog/craftsmen-know-their-tools): IDE, OS/terminal, debugging, static analyzers, formatters, test frameworks, CI, CD, etc.
1.  A senior developer **knows how to choose the right tool and framework**.
1.  A senior developer actively employs the Boyscout principle and helps update this documentation ("always leave the campground cleaner than you found it")
1.  **Most importantly**, a senior developer reminds us all, or reminds a given individual developer, when we do not live up to whatâ€™s written on this page, written in the [IxDF Zen Code](../../outdated/development/README.md#the-ixdf-zen-code), taught in the IxDF Culture Course, or considered a best practice among senior developers. A senior developer is thus a "guarantor" that we continually optimize our team spirit, fun, productivity, learning, results, impact on the world, and programming practices.
