# Scrum: ScrumTeam guide

Are you new to scrum? Please check out our [scrum overview](overview.md).

This guide is for **ScrumTeam** scrum role. To read more about scrum roles, please use this link: [scrum roles](overview.md#scrum-roles).

## Meeting: Sprint planning

**Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and ProductOwner.

**Duration**: 60-120 minutes, 5-20 minutes per person

**Purpose**: have a clean, balanced plan of significant issues.

### Prepare yourself

- Make sure you have a [backlog](backlog.md) filled with issues enough for the whole sprint.
- Briefly tell others which issues you are going to handle. For major issues, you can give a link to the issue.
- You don't need to talk about smallish issues. Just mention them if they are worth mentioning. This is a very, very important point because giving updates about smallish issues will make meetings longer and de-energize the team (e.g. do we really need to know that you updated a typo on a given page? :-) )
- Don't go into technical details! If you have questions, request a call with the suitable developer after sprint planning.

### Additional notes

- Try to commit yourself to finish all essential issues within the sprint, remember to account for testing and PR review.
- If you feel an issue is too big for one sprint, break it into smaller issues.
- Keep an eye on deadlines; ideally, we should deploy some important issues each sprint.

## Meeting: Retrospective and Demo

**Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and ProductOwner.

**Duration**: 60-90 minutes

### Part 1: Retrospective

**Duration**: 3-10 minutes per person

**Purpose**: provide some feedback and share your ideas on how you
and the whole team can become better.
You can identify the problem or even provide a solution on how to solve it.

ScrumTeam members should answer the following questions:

- What went well this Sprint?
- What went wrong this Sprint?
- What could we have done better?

### Part 2: Demo

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes per person

**Purpose**: Inspire the team by your results on learning, new features, refactorings, etc.

Prepare your hat! ü§†üéÖüë©‚ÄçüöÄ Or perhaps a mask ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è :)

Do you remember that we are a small product company who cares about culture and team spirit?
We know, nobody likes boring meetings.
Being a small product company means we don't have eager customers or crazy managers.
At the IDF, demo meeting is a time to **celebrate our wins**; it's not to sell our work to customers or managers!
Please be crazy as much as you can be with your demos, we like having fun!

ScrumTeam should prepare a small demo of new features (if any) that they've done on the past sprint. Possible ways to demonstrate what you've done within the recent sprint are as follows:

- A link to a page with the new feature/function. Links from all servers including your local machine (Remember `share idf.test` command to share your local machine to outside people, or you can share your screen instead) are accepted.
- A new API (readable usage examples using [gist](https://gist.github.com/) or code screenshots using https://carbon.now.sh).
- Charts (e.g., for performance tasks)
- Statistics (e.g., fewer errors per hour on New Relic due to one of your bug fixes)
- etc.

## Meeting: Daily scrum

**Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and optionally ProductOwner.

**Duration**: 10-45 minutes (2-7 minutes per person)

In Scrum, on each day of a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the "daily scrum".
Meetings are typically held at the same time each day.

It is a short daily call where ScrumTeam should answer three questions:

1.  What have you done starting from last daily scrum until now?
1.  What are you going to do until next daily scrum?
1.  Is there anything blocking you?
