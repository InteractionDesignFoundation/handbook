# Our Mission

Our mission is to genuinely improve the world by creating design education of the highest quality and the lowest possible cost.
We help as many designers, companies and students as possible improve their skills and future prospects—regardless of their location or background.
This is the reason we exist.

We LOVE that we make a big difference to millions of people around the world.

Not only do we help millions build a better future for themselves, but we also teach them to apply their new design skills to improve the quality of life for humankind.
We live in a world filled with inefficient and inhumane design—there lies a huge opportunity to make a positive impact through great design!
