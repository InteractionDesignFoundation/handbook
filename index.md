            <ul class="zen-section text-left md:text-justify">
                <li>We care deeply about "long-term code quality".</li>
                <li>We do it "incrementally"; first do it, then do it right, then do it better.</li>
                <li>We follow the boy scout principle; "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.".</li>
                <li>We believe in the broken window theory; that's why we fix anything that's broken, as soon as we see it.</li>
                <li>We use a "language of commitment": Say "yes" only if we (can/will) do it.</li>
                <li>We tell others about potential problems as soon as possible.</li>
                <li>We favor "explicit", "simple", "automated", "tested", and "flat".</li>
                <li>We have "one" <i>(and preferably "only one")</i> way of doing things.</li>
                <li>We make it "easy" to do "follow" our conventions and "difficult" otherwise.</li>
                <li>We code in a way that doesn't require documentation or explanation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="h3">Team</h3>
            <ul class="zen-section">
                <li>We celebrate our achievements and encourage everyone to contribute.</li>
                <li>We all have decision-making authority, and everyone in the team is committed to each other's success.</li>
                <li>We have a flat hierarchy; everyone does everything possible to never fail one another.</li>
                <li>We don't punish anyone for making mistakes.</li>
                <li>We care about communication; we believe the "how" in communication is as important as the "what".</li>

            <h3 class="h3">Productivity</h3>
            <ul class="zen-section">
                <li>We believe motivation and productivity come naturally when you work on something you're passionate about.</li>
                <li>We are action-oriented and strong believers in the maxim "ideas are worthless without execution."</li>
                <li>We have enormous degrees of freedom because we are able to live up to that responsibility.</li>
                <li>We finish what we have started; we don't feel good until we've carved a unicorn out of the monster.</li>
                <li>We are "subversives" to a certain point-we understand small acts of defiance can lead to better outcomes.</li>
                <li>We know that even small tasks can give us emotional rewards when we know why we are doing them.</li>
                <li>We set audacious but achievable goals by breaking them into small and concrete plans.</li>
                <li>We welcome critique; we use our mistakes in a constructive way to become stronger.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="h3">Community</h3>
            <ul class="zen-section">
                <li>We exist, because our community exists.</li>
                <li>Our codebase reflects the high expectations of our community.</li>
                <li>We constantly reshape our platform and codebase based on our community's needs.</li>
                <li>We believe our platform and community will make the world a better place.</li>
