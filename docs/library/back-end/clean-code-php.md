## Introduction

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book
[*Clean Code*](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882),
adapted for PHP. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
readable, reusable, and refactorable software in PHP.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be universally 
agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are ones codified over many 
years of collective experience by the authors of *Clean Code*.

Inspired from [clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript).

Although many developers still use PHP 5, most of the examples in this article only work with PHP 7.1+.

## Variables

### Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

**Bad:**

```php
$ymdstr = $moment->format('y-m-d');
```

**Good:**

```php
$currentDate = $moment->format('y-m-d');
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable

**Bad:**

```php
getUserInfo();
getUserData();
getUserRecord();
getUserProfile();
```

**Good:**

```php
getUser();
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use searchable names (part 1)

We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we do write is 
readable and searchable. By *not* naming variables that end up being meaningful for 
understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable.

**Bad:**

```php
// What the heck is 448 for?
$result = $serializer->serialize($data, 448);
```

**Good:**

```php
$json = $serializer->serialize($data, JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_PRETTY_PRINT | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE);
```

### Use searchable names (part 2)

**Bad:**

```php
// What the heck is 4 for?
if ($user->access & 4) {
    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class User
{
    const ACCESS_READ = 1;
    const ACCESS_CREATE = 2;
    const ACCESS_UPDATE = 4;
    const ACCESS_DELETE = 8;
}

if ($user->access & User::ACCESS_UPDATE) {
    // do edit ...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use explanatory variables

**Bad:**

```php
$address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014';
$cityZipCodeRegex = '/^[^,]+,\s*(.+?)\s*(\d{5})$/';
preg_match($cityZipCodeRegex, $address, $matches);

saveCityZipCode($matches[1], $matches[2]);
```

**Not bad:**

It's better, but we are still heavily dependent on regex.

```php
$address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014';
$cityZipCodeRegex = '/^[^,]+,\s*(.+?)\s*(\d{5})$/';
preg_match($cityZipCodeRegex, $address, $matches);

[, $city, $zipCode] = $matches;
saveCityZipCode($city, $zipCode);
```

**Good:**

Decrease dependence on regex by naming subpatterns.

```php
$address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014';
$cityZipCodeRegex = '/^[^,]+,\s*(?<city>.+?)\s*(?<zipCode>\d{5})$/';
preg_match($cityZipCodeRegex, $address, $matches);

saveCityZipCode($matches['city'], $matches['zipCode']);
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid nesting too deeply and return early (part 1)

Too many if-else statements can make your code hard to follow. Explicit is better
than implicit.

**Bad:**

```php
function isShopOpen($day): bool
{
    if ($day) {
        if (is_string($day)) {
            $day = strtolower($day);
            if ($day === 'friday') {
                return true;
            } elseif ($day === 'saturday') {
                return true;
            } elseif ($day === 'sunday') {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function isShopOpen(string $day): bool
{
    if (empty($day)) {
        return false;
    }

    $openingDays = [
        'friday', 'saturday', 'sunday'
    ];

    return in_array(strtolower($day), $openingDays, true);
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid nesting too deeply and return early (part 2)

**Bad:**

```php
function fibonacci(int $n)
{
    if ($n < 50) {
        if ($n !== 0) {
            if ($n !== 1) {
                return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2);
            } else {
                return 1;
            }
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    } else {
        return 'Not supported';
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function fibonacci(int $n): int
{
    if ($n === 0 || $n === 1) {
        return $n;
    }

    if ($n > 50) {
        throw new \Exception('Not supported');
    }

    return fibonacci($n - 1) + fibonacci($n - 2);
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Mental Mapping

Don’t force the reader of your code to translate what the variable means.
Explicit is better than implicit.

**Bad:**

```php
$l = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];

for ($i = 0; $i < count($l); $i++) {
    $li = $l[$i];
    doStuff();
    doSomeOtherStuff();
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
    // Wait, what is `$li` for again?
    dispatch($li);
}
```

**Good:**

```php
$locations = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];

foreach ($locations as $location) {
    doStuff();
    doSomeOtherStuff();
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
    dispatch($location);
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't add unneeded context

If your class/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your
variable name.

**Bad:**

```php
class Car
{
    public $carMake;
    public $carModel;
    public $carColor;

    //...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class Car
{
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $color;

    //...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals

**Not good:**

This is not good because `$breweryName` can be `NULL`.

```php
function createMicrobrewery($breweryName = 'Hipster Brew Co.'): void
{
    // ...
}
```

**Not bad:**

This opinion is more understandable than the previous version, but it better controls the value of the variable.

```php
function createMicrobrewery($name = null): void
{
    $breweryName = $name ?: 'Hipster Brew Co.';
    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

You can use [type hinting](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration) and be sure that the `$breweryName` will not be `NULL`.

```php
function createMicrobrewery(string $breweryName = 'Hipster Brew Co.'): void
{
    // ...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Comparison

### Use [identical comparison](http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php)

**Not good:**

The simple comparison will convert the string in an integer.

```php
$a = '42';
$b = 42;

if ($a != $b) {
   // The expression will always pass
}
```

The comparison `$a != $b` returns `FALSE` but in fact it's `TRUE`!
The string `42` is different than the integer `42`.

**Good:**

The identical comparison will compare type and value.

```php
$a = '42';
$b = 42;

if ($a !== $b) {
    // The expression is verified
}
```

The comparison `$a !== $b` returns `TRUE`.

Note that PHPUnit 2 diffirent method for identical and regular comparisons: `assertSame` and `assertEquals`. Please use `assertSame` where it's possible.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Functions

### Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)

Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it makes 
testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a combinatorial explosion 
where you have to test tons of different cases with each separate argument.

Zero arguments is the ideal case. One or two arguments is ok, and three should be avoided. 
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have more than two 
arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases where it's not, most 
of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an argument.

**Bad:**

```php
function createMenu(string $title, string $body, string $buttonText, bool $cancellable): void
{
    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class MenuConfig
{
    public $title;
    public $body;
    public $buttonText;
    public $cancellable = false;
}

$config = new MenuConfig();
$config->title = 'Foo';
$config->body = 'Bar';
$config->buttonText = 'Baz';
$config->cancellable = true;

function createMenu(MenuConfig $config): void
{
    // ...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Functions should do one thing

This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions do more 
than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about. When you can isolate 
a function to just one action, they can be refactored easily and your code will read much 
cleaner. If you take nothing else away from this guide other than this, you'll be ahead 
of many developers.

**Bad:**

```php
function emailClients(array $clients): void
{
    foreach ($clients as $client) {
        $clientRecord = $db->find($client);
        if ($clientRecord->isActive()) {
            email($client);
        }
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function emailClients(array $clients): void
{
    $activeClients = activeClients($clients);
    array_walk($activeClients, 'email');
}

function activeClients(array $clients): array
{
    return array_filter($clients, 'isClientActive');
}

function isClientActive(int $client): bool
{
    $clientRecord = $db->find($client);

    return $clientRecord->isActive();
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Function names should say what they do

**Bad:**

```php
class Email
{
    //...

    public function handle(): void
    {
        mail($this->to, $this->subject, $this->body);
    }
}

$message = new Email(...);
// What is this? A handle for the message? Are we writing to a file now?
$message->handle();
```

**Good:**

```php
class Email 
{
    //...

    public function send(): void
    {
        mail($this->to, $this->subject, $this->body);
    }
}

$message = new Email(...);
// Clear and obvious
$message->send();
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Functions should only be one level of abstraction

When you have more than one level of abstraction your function is usually
doing too much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier
testing.

**Bad:**

```php
function parseBetterJSAlternative(string $code): void
{
    $regexes = [
        // ...
    ];

    $statements = explode(' ', $code);
    $tokens = [];
    foreach ($regexes as $regex) {
        foreach ($statements as $statement) {
            // ...
        }
    }

    $ast = [];
    foreach ($tokens as $token) {
        // lex...
    }

    foreach ($ast as $node) {
        // parse...
    }
}
```

**Bad too:**

We have carried out some of the functionality, but the `parseBetterJSAlternative()` function is still very complex and not testable.

```php
function tokenize(string $code): array
{
    $regexes = [
        // ...
    ];

    $statements = explode(' ', $code);
    $tokens = [];
    foreach ($regexes as $regex) {
        foreach ($statements as $statement) {
            $tokens[] = /* ... */;
        }
    }

    return $tokens;
}

function lexer(array $tokens): array
{
    $ast = [];
    foreach ($tokens as $token) {
        $ast[] = /* ... */;
    }

    return $ast;
}

function parseBetterJSAlternative(string $code): void
{
    $tokens = tokenize($code);
    $ast = lexer($tokens);
    foreach ($ast as $node) {
        // parse...
    }
}
```

**Good:**

The best solution is move out the dependencies of `parseBetterJSAlternative()` function.

```php
class Tokenizer
{
    public function tokenize(string $code): array
    {
        $regexes = [
            // ...
        ];

        $statements = explode(' ', $code);
        $tokens = [];
        foreach ($regexes as $regex) {
            foreach ($statements as $statement) {
                $tokens[] = /* ... */;
            }
        }

        return $tokens;
    }
}

class Lexer
{
    public function lexify(array $tokens): array
    {
        $ast = [];
        foreach ($tokens as $token) {
            $ast[] = /* ... */;
        }

        return $ast;
    }
}

class BetterJSAlternative
{
    private $tokenizer;
    private $lexer;

    public function __construct(Tokenizer $tokenizer, Lexer $lexer)
    {
        $this->tokenizer = $tokenizer;
        $this->lexer = $lexer;
    }

    public function parse(string $code): void
    {
        $tokens = $this->tokenizer->tokenize($code);
        $ast = $this->lexer->lexify($tokens);
        foreach ($ast as $node) {
            // parse...
        }
    }
}
```

### Don't use flags as function parameters

Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions should 
do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths 
based on a boolean.

**Bad:**

```php
function createFile(string $name, bool $temp = false): void
{
    if ($temp) {
        touch('./temp/'.$name);
    } else {
        touch($name);
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function createFile(string $name): void
{
    touch($name);
}

function createTempFile(string $name): void
{
    touch('./temp/'.$name);
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Side Effects

A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in and 
return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file, modifying 
some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a stranger.

Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous 
example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to centralize where 
you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes that write to a particular 
file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.

The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects without
any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything, and not 
centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will be happier 
than the vast majority of other programmers.

**Bad:**

```php
// Global variable referenced by following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it could break it.
$name = 'Ryan McDermott';

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(): void
{
    global $name;

    $name = explode(' ', $name);
}

splitIntoFirstAndLastName();

var_dump($name); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```

**Good:**

```php
function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(string $name): array
{
    return explode(' ', $name);
}

$name = 'Ryan McDermott';
$newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName($name);

var_dump($name); // 'Ryan McDermott';
var_dump($newName); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Names should describe side effects

Names should describe everything that a function, variable, or class is or does. Don’t hide side effects with a name. Don’t use a simple verb to describe a function that does more than just that simple action.

**Bad:**

```php
public function getProfile(): Profile
{
   if ($this->profile === null) {
      $this->profile = new Profile($this);
      $this->save();
   }
   
   return $this->profile;
}
```

**Good:**

```php
public function createOrReturnProfile(): Profile
{
   if ($this->profile === null) {
      $this->profile = new Profile($this);
      $this->save();
   }
   
   return $this->profile;
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't write to global functions

Polluting globals is a bad practice in many languages because you could clash with another 
library and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an exception in 
production. Let's think about an example: what if you wanted to have configuration array?
You could write global function like `config()`, but it could clash with another library 
that tried to do the same thing.

**Bad:**

```php
function config(): array
{
    return  [
        'foo' => 'bar',
    ]
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class Configuration
{
    private $configuration = [];

    public function __construct(array $configuration)
    {
        $this->configuration = $configuration;
    }

    public function get(string $key): ?string
    {
        return isset($this->configuration[$key]) ? $this->configuration[$key] : null;
    }
}
```

Load configuration and create instance of `Configuration` class 

```php
$configuration = new Configuration([
    'foo' => 'bar',
]);
```

And now you must use instance of `Configuration` in your application.

### Don't use a Singleton pattern

Singleton is an [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern). Paraphrased from Brian Button:
 1. They are generally used as a **global instance**, why is that so bad? Because **you hide the dependencies** of your application in your code, instead of exposing them through the interfaces. Making something global to avoid passing it around is a [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell).
 2. They violate the [single responsibility principle](#single-responsibility-principle-srp): by virtue of the fact that **they control their own creation and lifecycle**.
 3. They inherently cause code to be tightly [coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29). This makes faking them out under **test rather difficult** in many cases.
 4. They carry state around for the lifetime of the application. Another hit to testing since **you can end up with a situation where tests need to be ordered** which is a big no for unit tests. Why? Because each unit test should be independent from the other.

There is also very good thoughts by [Misko Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com/about/) about the [root of problem](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/25/root-cause-of-singletons/).

**Bad:**

```php
class DBConnection
{
    private static $instance;

    private function __construct(string $dsn)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public static function getInstance(): DBConnection
    {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }

        return self::$instance;
    }

    // ...
}

$singleton = DBConnection::getInstance();
```

**Good:**

```php
class DBConnection
{
    public function __construct(string $dsn)
    {
        // ...
    }

     // ...
}
```

Create instance of `DBConnection` class and configure it with [DSN](http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.construct.php#refsect1-pdo.construct-parameters).

```php
$connection = new DBConnection($dsn);
```

And now you must use instance of `DBConnection` in your application.

### Encapsulate conditionals

**Bad:**

```php
if ($article->state === 'published') {
    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
if ($article->isPublished()) {
    // ...
}
```

**Bad:**

```php
if ($article->isRejected() && !$article->isPublished()) {
    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
if ($article->shouldBeDeleted()) {
    // ...
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid negative conditionals

**Bad:**

```php
function isDOMNodeNotPresent(\DOMNode $node): bool
{
    // ...
}

if (!isDOMNodeNotPresent($node))
{
    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function isDOMNodePresent(\DOMNode $node): bool
{
    // ...
}

if (isDOMNodePresent($node)) {
    // ...
}
```

### Avoid conditionals

This seems like an impossible task. Upon first hearing this, most people say,
"how am I supposed to do anything without an `if` statement?" The answer is that
you can use polymorphism to achieve the same task in many cases. The second
question is usually, "well that's great but why would I want to do that?" The
answer is a previous clean code concept we learned: a function should only do
one thing. When you have classes and functions that have `if` statements, you
are telling your user that your function does more than one thing. Remember,
just do one thing.

**Bad:**

```php
class Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int
    {
        switch ($this->type) {
            case '777':
                return $this->getMaxAltitude() - $this->getPassengerCount();
            case 'Air Force One':
                return $this->getMaxAltitude();
            case 'Cessna':
                return $this->getMaxAltitude() - $this->getFuelExpenditure();
        }
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
interface Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int;
}

class Boeing777 implements Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int
    {
        return $this->getMaxAltitude() - $this->getPassengerCount();
    }
}

class AirForceOne implements Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int
    {
        return $this->getMaxAltitude();
    }
}

class Cessna implements Airplane
{
    // ...

    public function getCruisingAltitude(): int
    {
        return $this->getMaxAltitude() - $this->getFuelExpenditure();
    }
}
```

### Avoid type-checking (part 1)

PHP is untyped, which means your functions can take any type of argument.
Sometimes you are bitten by this freedom and it becomes tempting to do
type-checking in your functions. There are many ways to avoid having to do this.
The first thing to consider is consistent APIs.

**Bad:**

```php
function travelToTexas($vehicle): void
{
    if ($vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {
        $vehicle->pedalTo(new Location('texas'));
    } elseif ($vehicle instanceof Car) {
        $vehicle->driveTo(new Location('texas'));
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function travelToTexas(Traveler $vehicle): void
{
    $vehicle->travelTo(new Location('texas'));
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid type-checking (part 2)

If you are working with basic primitive values like strings, integers, and arrays,
and you use PHP 7+ and you can't use polymorphism but you still feel the need to
type-check, you should consider
[type declaration](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration)
or strict mode. It provides you with static typing on top of standard PHP syntax.
The problem with manually type-checking is that doing it will require so much
extra verbiage that the faux "type-safety" you get doesn't make up for the lost
readability. Keep your PHP clean, write good tests, and have good code reviews.
Otherwise, do all of that but with PHP strict type declaration or strict mode.

**Bad:**

```php
function combine($val1, $val2): int
{
    if (!is_numeric($val1) || !is_numeric($val2)) {
        throw new \Exception('Must be of type Number');
    }

    return $val1 + $val2;
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function combine(int $val1, int $val2): int
{
    return $val1 + $val2;
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Remove dead code

Dead code is just as bad as duplicate code. There's no reason to keep it in
your codebase. If it's not being called, get rid of it! It will still be safe
in your version history if you still need it.

**Bad:**

```php
function oldRequestModule(string $url): void
{
    // ...
}

function newRequestModule(string $url): void
{
    // ...
}

$request = newRequestModule($requestUrl);
inventoryTracker('apples', $request, 'www.inventory-awesome.io');
```

**Good:**

```php
function requestModule(string $url): void
{
    // ...
}

$request = requestModule($requestUrl);
inventoryTracker('apples', $request, 'www.inventory-awesome.io');
```

## Objects and Data Structures

### Use object encapsulation

In PHP you can set `public`, `protected` and `private` keywords for methods. 
Using it, you can control properties modification on an object. 

* When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have
to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
* Makes adding validation simple when doing a `set`.
* Encapsulates the internal representation.
* Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.
* Inheriting this class, you can override default functionality.
* You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a
server.

Additionally, this is part of [Open/Closed](#openclosed-principle-ocp) principle.

**Bad:**

```php
class BankAccount
{
    public $balance = 1000;
}

$bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Buy shoes...
$bankAccount->balance -= 100;
```

**Good:**

```php
class BankAccount
{
    private $balance;

    public function __construct(int $balance = 1000)
    {
      $this->balance = $balance;
    }

    public function withdraw(int $amount): void
    {
        if ($amount > $this->balance) {
            throw new \Exception('Amount greater than available balance.');
        }

        $this->balance -= $amount;
    }

    public function deposit(int $amount): void
    {
        $this->balance += $amount;
    }

    public function getBalance(): int
    {
        return $this->balance;
    }
}

$bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Buy shoes...
$bankAccount->withdraw($shoesPrice);

// Get balance
$balance = $bankAccount->getBalance();
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Make objects have private/protected members

* `public` methods and properties are most dangerous for changes, because some outside code may easily rely on them and you can't control what code relies on them. **Modifications in class are dangerous for all users of class.**
* `protected` modifier are as dangerous as public, because they are available in scope of any child class. This effectively means that difference between public and protected is only in access mechanism, but encapsulation guarantee remains the same. **Modifications in class are dangerous for all descendant classes.**
* `private` modifier guarantees that code is **dangerous to modify only in boundaries of single class** (you are safe for modifications and you won't have [Jenga effect](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jengaphobia&defid=2494196)).

Therefore, use `private` by default and `public/protected` when you need to provide access for external classes.

For more information, you can read the [blog post](http://fabien.potencier.org/pragmatism-over-theory-protected-vs-private.html)
on this topic written by [Fabien Potencier](https://github.com/fabpot).

**Bad:**

```php
class Employee
{
    public $name;

    public function __construct(string $name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
}

$employee = new Employee('John Doe');
echo 'Employee name: '.$employee->name; // Employee name: John Doe
```

**Good:**

```php
class Employee
{
    private $name;

    public function __construct(string $name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

$employee = new Employee('John Doe');
echo 'Employee name: '.$employee->getName(); // Employee name: John Doe
```

## Classes

### Prefer composition over inheritance

As stated famously in [*Design Patterns*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by the Gang of Four,
you should prefer composition over inheritance where you can. There are lots of
good reasons to use inheritance and lots of good reasons to use composition.
The main point for this maxim is that if your mind instinctively goes for
inheritance, try to think if composition could model your problem better. In some
cases it can.

You might be wondering then, "when should I use inheritance?" It
depends on your problem at hand, but this is a decent list of when inheritance
makes more sense than composition:

1. Your inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship and not a "has-a"
relationship (Human->Animal vs. User->UserDetails).
2. You can reuse code from the base classes (Humans can move like all animals).
3. You want to make global changes to derived classes by changing a base class.
(Change the caloric expenditure of all animals when they move).

**Bad:**

```php
class Employee 
{
    private $name;
    private $email;

    public function __construct(string $name, string $email)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->email = $email;
    }

    // ...
}

// Bad because Employees "have" tax data. 
// EmployeeTaxData is not a type of Employee

class EmployeeTaxData extends Employee 
{
    private $ssn;
    private $salary;
    
    public function __construct(string $name, string $email, string $ssn, string $salary)
    {
        parent::__construct($name, $email);

        $this->ssn = $ssn;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class EmployeeTaxData 
{
    private $ssn;
    private $salary;

    public function __construct(string $ssn, string $salary)
    {
        $this->ssn = $ssn;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    // ...
}

class Employee 
{
    private $name;
    private $email;
    private $taxData;

    public function __construct(string $name, string $email)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->email = $email;
    }

    public function setTaxData(string $ssn, string $salary)
    {
        $this->taxData = new EmployeeTaxData($ssn, $salary);
    }

    // ...
}
```

### Avoid fluent interfaces

A [Fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) is an object
oriented API that aims to improve the readability of the source code by using
[Method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining).

While there can be some contexts, frequently builder objects, where this
pattern reduces the verbosity of the code (for example the [PHPUnit Mock Builder](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/test-doubles.html)
or the [Doctrine Query Builder](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/query-builder.html)),
more often it comes at some costs:

1. Breaks [Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29).
2. Breaks [Decorators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern).
3. Is harder to [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) in a test suite.
4. Makes diffs of commits harder to read.

For more information, you can read the full [blog post](https://ocramius.github.io/blog/fluent-interfaces-are-evil/)
on this topic written by [Marco Pivetta](https://github.com/Ocramius).

**Bad:**

```php
class Car
{
    private $make = 'Honda';
    private $model = 'Accord';
    private $color = 'white';

    public function setMake(string $make): self
    {
        $this->make = $make;

        // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
        return $this;
    }

    public function setModel(string $model): self
    {
        $this->model = $model;

        // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
        return $this;
    }

    public function setColor(string $color): self
    {
        $this->color = $color;

        // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
        return $this;
    }

    public function dump(): void
    {
        var_dump($this->make, $this->model, $this->color);
    }
}

$car = (new Car())
  ->setColor('pink')
  ->setMake('Ford')
  ->setModel('F-150')
  ->dump();
```

**Good:**

```php
class Car
{
    private $make = 'Honda';
    private $model = 'Accord';
    private $color = 'white';

    public function setMake(string $make): void
    {
        $this->make = $make;
    }

    public function setModel(string $model): void
    {
        $this->model = $model;
    }

    public function setColor(string $color): void
    {
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    public function dump(): void
    {
        var_dump($this->make, $this->model, $this->color);
    }
}

$car = new Car();
$car->setColor('pink');
$car->setMake('Ford');
$car->setModel('F-150');
$car->dump();
```

### Prefer final classes

The `final` should be used whenever possible:

1. It prevents uncontrolled inheritance chain.
2. It encourages [composition](#prefer-composition-over-inheritance).
3. It encourages the [Single Responsibility Pattern](#single-responsibility-principle-srp).
4. It encourages developers to use your public methods instead of extending the class to get access on protected ones.
5. It allows you to change your code without any break of applications that use your class.

The only condition is that your class should implement an interface and no other public methods are defined.

For more information, you can read [the blog post](https://ocramius.github.io/blog/when-to-declare-classes-final/)
on this topic written by [Marco Pivetta (Ocramius)](https://ocramius.github.io/).

**Bad:**

```php
final class Car
{
    private $color;
    
    public function __construct($color)
    {
        $this->color = $color;
    }
    
    /**
     * @return string The color of the vehicle
     */
    public function getColor() 
    {
        return $this->color;
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
interface Vehicle
{
    /**
     * @return string The color of the vehicle
     */
    public function getColor();
}

final class Car implements Vehicle
{
    private $color;
    
    public function __construct($color)
    {
        $this->color = $color;
    }
    
    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function getColor() 
    {
        return $this->color;
    }
}
```

## Tests

### Insufficient Tests

How many tests should be in a test suite? Unfortunately, the metric many programmers use is “That seems like enough.” A test suite should test everything that could possibly break. The tests are insufficient so long as there are conditions that have not been explored by the tests or calculations that have not been validated.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use a Coverage Tool!

Coverage tools reports gaps in your testing strategy. They make it easy to find modules, classes, and functions that are insufficiently tested. Most IDEs give you a visual indication, marking lines that are covered in green and those that are uncovered in red. This makes it quick and easy to find if or catch statements whose bodies haven’t been checked.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don’t Skip Trivial Tests

They are easy to write and their documentary value is higher than the cost to produce them.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### An Ignored Test Is a Question about an Ambiguity

Sometimes we are uncertain about a behavioral detail because the requirements are unclear. We can express our question about the requirements as a test that is commented out, or as a test that annotated with @Ignore. Which you choose depends upon whether the ambiguity is about something that would compile or not.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Test Boundary Conditions

Take special care to test boundary conditions. We often get the middle of an algorithm right but misjudge the boundaries.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Exhaustively Test Near Bugs

Bugs tend to congregate. When you find a bug in a function, it is wise to do an exhaustive test of that function. You’ll probably find that the bug was not alone.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Patterns of Failure Are Revealing

Sometimes you can diagnose a problem by finding patterns in the way the test cases fail. This is another argument for making the test cases as complete as possible. Complete test cases, ordered in a reasonable way, expose patterns.

As a simple example, suppose you noticed that all tests with an input larger than five characters failed? Or what if any test that passed a negative number into the second argument of a function failed? Sometimes just seeing the pattern of red and green on the test report is enough to spark the “Aha!” that leads to the solution. Look back at page 267 to see an interesting example of this in the `SerialDate` example.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Test Coverage Patterns Can Be Revealing

Looking at the code that is or is not executed by the passing tests gives clues to why the failing tests fail.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Tests Should Be Fast

A slow test is a test that won’t get run. When things get tight, it’s the slow tests that will be dropped from the suite. So do what you must to keep your tests fast.

## SOLID

**SOLID** is the mnemonic acronym introduced by Michael Feathers for the first five principles named by Robert Martin, which meant five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design.

 * [S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](#single-responsibility-principle-srp)
 * [O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](#openclosed-principle-ocp)
 * [L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](#liskov-substitution-principle-lsp)
 * [I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](#interface-segregation-principle-isp)
 * [D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](#dependency-inversion-principle-dip)

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

As stated in Clean Code, "There should never be more than one reason for a class
to change". It's tempting to jam-pack a class with a lot of functionality, like
when you can only take one suitcase on your flight. The issue with this is
that your class won't be conceptually cohesive and it will give it many reasons
to change. Minimizing the amount of times you need to change a class is important.
It's important because if too much functionality is in one class and you modify a piece of it,
it can be difficult to understand how that will affect other dependent modules in
your codebase.

**Bad:**

```php
class UserSettings
{
    private $user;

    public function __construct(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }

    public function changeSettings(array $settings): void
    {
        if ($this->verifyCredentials()) {
            // ...
        }
    }

    private function verifyCredentials(): bool
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
class UserAuth 
{
    private $user;

    public function __construct(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }
    
    public function verifyCredentials(): bool
    {
        // ...
    }
}

class UserSettings 
{
    private $user;
    private $auth;

    public function __construct(User $user) 
    {
        $this->user = $user;
        $this->auth = new UserAuth($user);
    }

    public function changeSettings(array $settings): void
    {
        if ($this->auth->verifyCredentials()) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

As stated by Bertrand Meyer, "software entities (classes, modules, functions,
etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification." What does that
mean though? This principle basically states that you should allow users to
add new functionalities without changing existing code.

**Bad:**

```php
abstract class Adapter
{
    protected $name;

    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

class AjaxAdapter extends Adapter
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();

        $this->name = 'ajaxAdapter';
    }
}

class NodeAdapter extends Adapter
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();

        $this->name = 'nodeAdapter';
    }
}

class HttpRequester
{
    private $adapter;

    public function __construct(Adapter $adapter)
    {
        $this->adapter = $adapter;
    }

    public function fetch(string $url): Promise
    {
        $adapterName = $this->adapter->getName();

        if ($adapterName === 'ajaxAdapter') {
            return $this->makeAjaxCall($url);
        } elseif ($adapterName === 'httpNodeAdapter') {
            return $this->makeHttpCall($url);
        }
    }

    private function makeAjaxCall(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }

    private function makeHttpCall(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
interface Adapter
{
    public function request(string $url): Promise;
}

class AjaxAdapter implements Adapter
{
    public function request(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }
}

class NodeAdapter implements Adapter
{
    public function request(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }
}

class HttpRequester
{
    private $adapter;

    public function __construct(Adapter $adapter)
    {
        $this->adapter = $adapter;
    }

    public function fetch(string $url): Promise
    {
        return $this->adapter->request($url);
    }
}
```

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

This is a scary term for a very simple concept. It's formally defined as "If S
is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S
(i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any
of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed,
etc.)." That's an even scarier definition.

The best explanation for this is if you have a parent class and a child class,
then the base class and child class can be used interchangeably without getting
incorrect results. This might still be confusing, so let's take a look at the
classic Square-Rectangle example. Mathematically, a square is a rectangle, but
if you model it using the "is-a" relationship via inheritance, you quickly
get into trouble.

**Bad:**

```php
class Rectangle
{
    protected $width = 0;
    protected $height = 0;

    public function setWidth(int $width): void
    {
        $this->width = $width;
    }

    public function setHeight(int $height): void
    {
        $this->height = $height;
    }

    public function getArea(): int
    {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}

class Square extends Rectangle
{
    public function setWidth(int $width): void
    {
        $this->width = $this->height = $width;
    }

    public function setHeight(int $height): void
    {
        $this->width = $this->height = $height;
    }
}

function printArea(Rectangle $rectangle): void
{
    $rectangle->setWidth(4);
    $rectangle->setHeight(5);
 
    // BAD: Will return 25 for Square. Should be 20.
    echo sprintf('%s has area %d.', get_class($rectangle), $rectangle->getArea()).PHP_EOL;
}

$rectangles = [new Rectangle(), new Square()];

foreach ($rectangles as $rectangle) {
    printArea($rectangle);
}
```

**Good:**

The best way is separate the quadrangles and allocation of a more general subtype for both shapes.

Despite the apparent similarity of the square and the rectangle, they are different.
A square has much in common with a rhombus, and a rectangle with a parallelogram, but they are not subtype.
A square, a rectangle, a rhombus and a parallelogram are separate shapes with their own properties, albeit similar.

```php
interface Shape
{
    public function getArea(): int;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape
{
    private $width = 0;
    private $height = 0;

    public function __construct(int $width, int $height)
    {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }

    public function getArea(): int
    {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}

class Square implements Shape
{
    private $length = 0;

    public function __construct(int $length)
    {
        $this->length = $length;
    }

    public function getArea(): int
    {
        return $this->length ** 2;
    }
}

function printArea(Shape $shape): void
{
    echo sprintf('%s has area %d.', get_class($shape), $shape->getArea()).PHP_EOL;
}

$shapes = [new Rectangle(4, 5), new Square(5)];

foreach ($shapes as $shape) {
    printArea($shape);
}
```

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

ISP states that "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that
they do not use." 

A good example to look at that demonstrates this principle is for
classes that require large settings objects. Not requiring clients to set up
huge amounts of options is beneficial, because most of the time they won't need
all of the settings. Making them optional helps prevent having a "fat interface".

**Bad:**

```php
interface Employee
{
    public function work(): void;

    public function eat(): void;
}

class Human implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        // ...... eating in lunch break
    }
}

class Robot implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        //.... working much more
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        //.... robot can't eat, but it must implement this method
    }
}
```

**Good:**

Not every worker is an employee, but every employee is a worker.

```php
interface Workable
{
    public function work(): void;
}

interface Feedable
{
    public function eat(): void;
}

interface Employee extends Feedable, Workable
{
}

class Human implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        //.... eating in lunch break
    }
}

// robot can only work
class Robot implements Workable
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }
}
```

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This principle states two essential things:
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on
abstractions.

This can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with PHP frameworks (like Symfony), you've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency
Injection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level
modules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up.
It can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces
the coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because
it makes your code hard to refactor.

**Bad:**

```php
class Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }
}

class Robot extends Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        //.... working much more
    }
}

class Manager
{
    private $employee;

    public function __construct(Employee $employee)
    {
        $this->employee = $employee;
    }

    public function manage(): void
    {
        $this->employee->work();
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
interface Employee
{
    public function work(): void;
}

class Human implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }
}

class Robot implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        //.... working much more
    }
}

class Manager
{
    private $employee;

    public function __construct(Employee $employee)
    {
        $this->employee = $employee;
    }

    public function manage(): void
    {
        $this->employee->work();
    }
}
```

## Don’t repeat yourself (DRY)

Try to observe the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle.

Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because 
it means that there's more than one place to alter something if you need to 
change some logic.

Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your 
tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that
you keep this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with
tomatoes in them. If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!

Often you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly
different things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you
to have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing 
duplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of different 
things with just one function/module/class.

Getting the abstraction right is critical, that's why you should follow the
SOLID principles laid out in the [Classes](#classes) section. Bad abstractions can be
worse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make
a good abstraction, do it! Don't repeat yourself, otherwise you'll find yourself 
updating multiple places any time you want to change one thing.

**Bad:**

```php
function showDeveloperList(array $developers): void
{
    foreach ($developers as $developer) {
        $expectedSalary = $developer->calculateExpectedSalary();
        $experience = $developer->getExperience();
        $githubLink = $developer->getGithubLink();
        $data = [
            $expectedSalary,
            $experience,
            $githubLink
        ];

        render($data);
    }
}

function showManagerList(array $managers): void
{
    foreach ($managers as $manager) {
        $expectedSalary = $manager->calculateExpectedSalary();
        $experience = $manager->getExperience();
        $githubLink = $manager->getGithubLink();
        $data = [
            $expectedSalary,
            $experience,
            $githubLink
        ];

        render($data);
    }
}
```

**Good:**

```php
function showList(array $employees): void
{
    foreach ($employees as $employee) {
        $expectedSalary = $employee->calculateExpectedSalary();
        $experience = $employee->getExperience();
        $githubLink = $employee->getGithubLink();
        $data = [
            $expectedSalary,
            $experience,
            $githubLink
        ];

        render($data);
    }
}
```

**Very good:**

It is better to use a compact version of the code.

```php
function showList(array $employees): void
{
    foreach ($employees as $employee) {
        render([
            $employee->calculateExpectedSalary(),
            $employee->getExperience(),
            $employee->getGithubLink()
        ]);
    }
}
```
