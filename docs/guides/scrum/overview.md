# Scrum in IxDF teams

Scrum is an agile and simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products.

Instead of providing complete, detailed descriptions of how everything is to be done on a project,
much of it is left up to the Scrum team. Afterall, the team will know best how to solve the problems and challenges they are presented with.

Scrum started in Software Development but is now being used as an approach to project management in all sorts of projects.

## Scrum Roles

- **[ScrumMaster](scrumMaster.md)**: helps Scrum practitioners achieve their highest level of performance.
- **[ProductOwner](productOwner.md)**: creates a compelling vision of the product, and then conveys that vision to the team through the product backlog.
- **[ScrumTeam](scrumTeam.md)**: contributes in whatever way they can to complete the work of each sprint.

## Scrum sprint

A scrum sprint is a regular, repeatable work cycle in scrum methodology during which work is completed and made ready for review.
In the IxDF, we usually use 2-weeks sprints.

Once Sprint Planning is finished - it should not be possible to add new tasks to sprint backlog. There are 2 exceptions for this rule:

- tasks with `urgency: high` label
- tasks with `blink of an eye` label if they are relevant to other issues from your backlog

### Sprint planning

- **Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and ProductOwner.
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours

The output of the sprint planning is a new backlog (todo-list) along with clear and short sprint goals.

### Daily scrum

- **Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and optionally ProductOwner.
- **Duration**: 10-45 mins

In Scrum, on each day of a sprint the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the "daily scrum.‚Äù
Meetings are typically held at the same time each day.

This is a short daily call where ScrumTeam should answer 3 questions:

1.  What have you done starting from last daily scrum until now?
1.  What are you going to do until next daily scrum?
1.  Is there anything blocking you?

### Demo and retrospective

- **Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and ProductOwner.
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours

**Part 1: Demo**:
In Scrum, each sprint is required to deliver a potentially shippable product increment.
For example, in the case of the development team, this means that at the end of each sprint the team has produced a coded, tested and usable piece of software. In the case of the editorial team, it means that at the end of each sprint the team has produced a coherent and definable piece of work (e.g. a number of lesson items, a number of videos, etc) that can be demo'ed/viewed and potentially shipped.

**Part 2: Sprint Retrospective**:
No matter how good a Scrum team is, there is always opportunity to improve.
Although a good Scrum team will be constantly looking for improvement opportunities, the team should set aside a brief, dedicated period at the end of each sprint to deliberately reflect on how they are doing, and to find ways to improve.
This occurs during the Sprint Retrospective.

## Scrum Board

The Scrum Board is a visual representation of a Scrum Sprint.
There are 4 task statuses availble to be used for the ScrumTeam:

1.  **backlog**: current sprint backlog, usually ordered by priorities.
1.  **in progress**: tasks that our developers are currently working on (one issue per developer).
1.  **on review/blocked**: issues that are on review or blocked. ScrumMaster should try to minimize the number of tasks in this column.
1.  **done**: finished issues (no matter if shipped to production or not)
