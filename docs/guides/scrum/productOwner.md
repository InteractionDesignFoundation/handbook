# Scrum: ProductOwner guide

Are you new to scrum? Please check out our [scrum overview](overview.md).

This guide is for **ProductOwner** scrum role. To read more about scrum roles please use this link: [scrum roles](overview.md#scrum-roles).

The ProductOwner is typically the project's key stakeholder.
Part of the ProductOwner responsibilities is to have a vision of what's to build, and convey that vision to the ScrumTeam.
This is key to successfully start any agile software development project.
The agile ProductOwner does this in part through the product backlog, which is a prioritized features list for the product.

The ProductOwner's job is to motivate the team with a clear, elevating goal.

## Meeting: Sprint planning

- **Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and ProductOwner.
