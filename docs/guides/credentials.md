# Credentials

We use [LastPass](https://lastpass.com) as the password manager.

## Question: Where can I find the security document which contains the credentials?

All credentials including site logins, server credentials, API credentials etc. are stored on LastPass.
If you don't have a LastPass account, please send an email to hello@interaction-design.org with the subject line "Please give me access to the password manager" containing:

- which site login(s) or credentials you need to have access
- your first name and last name (if they are not immediately visible with your email address)

Remember to send the email from your IDF team member email account (having the domain @team.interaction-design.org).
The emails being sent from personal accounts will be ignored for security reasons.

Once you've sent the email, please be patient. A LastPass account will be created for you and required credentials will be loaded onto your account.
You will receive an email from LastPass with instructions on how to access your account.

Once you have access to LastPass, please set up multifactor authentication for added security.
To achieve that, log in to your LastPass account and click "Account Settings" on the left-hand side menu.

Click on "Multifactor Options" on the top menu to see the options you have. You can choose any of them and click on the "Edit" button next to it to set it up. LastPass will guide you through the way to set it up. If you want any recommendation, LastPass Authenticator works well. :-) You download the app to your smartphone and verify your logins from there.

Furthermore:

- If you can't find a particular instance, and if you know the credentials of that instance, please add it so we can improve the document together. :-)
- If you can't find a particular instance, and if you **don't** know the credentials, then reach out to @gzg, and he will add it.
