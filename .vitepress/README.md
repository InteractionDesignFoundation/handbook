# VitePress

We use VitePress in a bit different way how it was intended to be used. We use it as a static site generator for our documentation.
That's why we have additional steps during a building process.

## Build

Build and preview:

```shell
yarn docs:build
yarn docs:preview
```

Live view (with live reload):

```shell
yarn docs:dev
```
