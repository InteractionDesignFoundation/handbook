Scrum: ProductOwner guide
=========================

Are you new to scrum? Please check out our [scrum overview](scrum.md). 

This guide is for **ProductOwner** scrum role. To read more about scrum roles please use this link: [scrum roles](scrum.md#scrum-roles).

The ProductOwner is typically the project's key stakeholder.
Part of the ProductOwner responsibilities is to have a vision of what's to build, and convey that vision to the ScrumTeam.
This is key to successfully start any agile software development project.
The agile ProductOwner does this in part through the product backlog, which is a prioritized features list for the product.

The ProductOwner's job is to motivate the team with a clear, elevating goal.


## Meeting: Sprint planning
 - **Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and ProductOwner.
 - **Duration**: 1-2 hours

ProductOwner should choose the highest priority features for the upcoming sprint and be ready to describe them to the ScrumTeam.


## Meeting: Daily scrum
 - **Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and optionally ProductOwner.
 - **Duration**: 10-45 mins

It's optional for ProductOwner - nothing to do from their side. They can optionally ask about cumulative sprint progress,
and rearrange priorities in the backlog.  


## Meeting: Demo and Retrospective
 - **Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and ProductOwner.
 - **Duration**: 1-2 hours

### Part 1: Demo
Ensure that all features are implemented in the right way (in domain terms).


### Part 2: Retrospective
Ensure that ScrumTeam and ScrumMaster are becoming better and better ☀️
