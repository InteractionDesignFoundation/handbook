Scrum: ScrumTeam guide
======================

Are you new to scrum? Please check out our [scrum overview](scrum.md). 

This guide is for **ScrumTeam** scrum role. To read more about scrum roles please use this link: [scrum roles](scrum.md#scrum-roles).


## Meeting: Sprint planning
**Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and ProductOwner.

**Duration**: 60-120 minutes, 5-20 minutes per person

**Purpose**: have a clean, balanced plan of really important issues.

### Prepare yourself
- Make sure you have a backlog filled with issues enough for the whole sprint (https://github.com/InteractionDesignFoundation/handbook/blob/master/roles/developer/scrum__backlog.md).
- Briefly tell others which issues you are going to handle. For major issues, you can give a link to the issue.
- You don't need to talk about smallish issues. Just mention them if they are worth mentioning.
- Don't go into technical details! If you have questions, request a call with the suitable developer after sprint planning.

### Additional notes

- Try to commit yourself to finish all important issues within the sprint, remember to account for testing and PR review.
- If you feel an issue is too big for one sprint, break it into smaller issues.
- Keep an eye on deadlines; ideally, we should deploy some important issues each sprint.


## Meeting: Daily scrum
**Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and optionally ProductOwner.

**Duration**: 10-45 minutes (2-7 minutes per person)

In Scrum, on each day of a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the "daily scrum.”
Meetings are typically held at the same time each day.

 This is a short daily call where ScrumTeam should answer to 3 questions:
 1. What have you done starting from last daily scrum until now?
 1. What are you going to do until next daily scrum?
 1. Is there anything blocking you?


## Meeting: Retrospective and Demo
**Attendees**: ScrumMaster, ScrumTeam, and ProductOwner.

**Duration**: 60-90 minutes

### Part 1: Retrospective
**Duration**: 3-10 minutes per person

**Purpose**: provide some feedback and share your ideas on how you
and the whole team can became better.
You can identify the problem or even provide a solution how to solve it.

ScrumTeam members should answer the following questions:
 - What went well in the Sprint?
 - What could be improved?
 - What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?



### Part 2: Demo
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes per person

**Purpose**: inspire team by your results on learning, new features, refactorings, etc.

ScrumTeam should prepare a small demo of new features (if any) that they've done on the past sprint. Possible ways to demonstrate what you've done within the past sprint are as follows:

 - A link to a page with the new feature/function. Links from all servers including your local machine (Remember `share idf.test` command to share your local machine to outside people, or you can share your screen instead) are accepted.
 - A new API (readable usage examples using [gist](https://gist.github.com/) or code screenshots using https://carbon.now.sh).
 - Charts (e.g. for performance tasks)
 - Statistics (e.g. less errors per hour on New Relic due to one of your bug fixes)
 - etc.
